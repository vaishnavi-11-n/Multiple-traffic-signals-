# 🚦 Multiple Traffic Lights Simulation

A Python program to simulate the behavior of multiple interconnected traffic lights—ideal for intersections or city grid scenarios.

## 🚀 Features

- Simulate two or more traffic signals at an intersection or on a road network
- Configurable signal durations and sequences
- Visual or terminal-based representation of traffic flow
- Synchronization logic (e.g., alternate signal changes)
- Option for pedestrian crossings or emergency vehicle priority (extendable)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- (Optional) Tkinter / Pygame / Matplotlib for GUI or visualization

## 📦 Installation

Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/vaishnavi-11-n/Traffic-Signal.git
cd Traffic-Signal


Install any dependencies (if using GUI or advanced visualization):

Example for Tkinter (usually comes with Python), or:
pip install pygame matplotlib


## 💡 Usage

Run the main simulation program:
python multiple_traffic_lights.py


**Configuration:**
- Edit the config section in the script to set the number of traffic signals and durations.
- For GUI, a window will display each signal’s status (red/yellow/green). For terminal, statuses will print at intervals.

**Output Example:**
- Visual grid showing the state of each traffic signal.
- Timed changes, ensuring no conflicting green signals (safe intersection logic).
